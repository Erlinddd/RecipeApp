Bake for 5 minutes per pound (10 minutes per kilo) of meat, so a 5-pound (2.2 kg) roast would bake for 25 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let the rib roast sit in the oven for 2 hours, making sure you do not open the oven door or else the residual heat will escape.  Once the 2 hours are up, remove the roast from the pan and pour the pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat."
